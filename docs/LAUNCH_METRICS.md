# Launch metrics

Stars are a lagging signal. Measure the path from discovery to durable use and
never publish numbers without a timestamped source.

| Metric | Definition | Source | Decision it informs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Unique visitors | GitHub repository unique visitors | GitHub Traffic | Reach |
| Star conversion | New stars / unique visitors | GitHub Traffic + Insights | README clarity |
| Demo success | Users reporting a successful demo | Issues/discussions | Onboarding friction |
| Action adoption | Public workflows using the Action, manually verified | GitHub code search | Product use |
| External contributors | Non-maintainer issue/PR authors | GitHub Insights | Contributor gravity |
| Useful feedback | Actionable issue, integration report, or reproducible edge case | Manual review | Roadmap |
| Retention proxy | Returning clones/visitors where available | GitHub Traffic | Continued interest |

## Daily log

Record once per day at a consistent time. Keep source screenshots/exports
private when they contain account-level data.

| Date/time (NPT) | Visitors | New stars | Conversion | Public adoptions | External contributors | Notes/source |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 2026-10-02 10:36 | — | 0 | — | 0 | 0 | Public GitHub baseline; authenticated traffic unavailable |

Do not backfill guesses. Use `—` for unavailable data and label estimates as
estimates. A 10,000-star week is a breakout scenario, not an acceptance test.

## Launch evidence

Published on 2026-10-02 after verifying the default-branch Test and CodeQL
workflows:

- [GitHub launch announcement](https://github.com/Aryalmilan-max/oss-link-auditor/discussions/7)
- [LinkedIn maintainer post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7511648988123815936/)
- [separate public consumer workflow](https://github.com/Aryalmilan-max/oss-link-auditor-consumer-demo/actions/runs/36429117129)

The consumer workflow proves reuse outside this repository but is owned by the
same maintainer, so it is not counted as independent adoption.
